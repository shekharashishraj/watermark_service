# Watermark Locking Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The PDF Watermark Service now includes a **position locking mechanism** that allows you to fix watermark positions and prevent accidental movement. This solves the issue where watermarks would continue moving after being placed.

## 🔒 How It Works

### **Unlocked Watermarks (Default State)**
- ✅ **Movable**: Can be dragged and repositioned
- ✅ **Editable**: Can be rotated and modified
- 🎨 **Visual**: Blue border and shadow when selected

### **Locked Watermarks**
- 🔒 **Fixed Position**: Cannot be dragged or moved
- 📍 **Absolute Positioning**: Position is fixed relative to the PDF page (not the viewer)
- ✅ **Editable**: Can still be rotated and removed
- 🎨 **Visual**: Green border, shadow, and lock indicator (✓)

## 🎮 Controls

### **For Unlocked Watermarks:**
When you select an unlocked watermark, you'll see three control buttons:

1. **✓ (Tick/Check)** - **Lock Position**
   - Click to fix the watermark in its current position
   - Prevents accidental movement
   - Changes watermark appearance to green with lock indicator

2. **🔄 (Rotate)** - **Rotate Watermark**
   - Rotates the watermark by 15 degrees
   - Can be used multiple times

3. **🗑️ (Trash)** - **Remove Watermark**
   - Completely removes the watermark from the view

### **For Locked Watermarks:**
When you select a locked watermark, you'll see two control buttons:

1. **🔄 (Rotate)** - **Unlock Position**
   - Click to unlock the watermark and allow movement again
   - Changes watermark appearance back to blue

2. **✗ (X)** - **Remove Watermark**
   - Completely removes the watermark from the view

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### **Unlocked Watermarks:**
- Blue border and shadow when selected
- Normal appearance when not selected

### **Locked Watermarks:**
- Green border and shadow
- Small green checkmark (✓) in the top-right corner
- Dashed green outline around the watermark

## 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Upload a PDF** and add watermarks
2. **Drag watermarks** to desired positions
3. **Click on a watermark** to select it
4. **Click the ✓ button** to lock its position
5. **Repeat** for other watermarks
6. **Apply watermarks** when all positions are finalized

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### **Status Bar Information:**
- Shows total number of watermarks
- Displays count of locked watermarks
- Provides helpful instructions based on current state

### **Smart Interactions:**
- Locked watermarks cannot be dragged
- Position updates are prevented for locked watermarks
- Local position changes are cleared when locking
- **Absolute PDF Positioning**: Locked watermarks maintain their position relative to the PDF page, not the viewer

### **Performance Benefits:**
- Reduces unnecessary server updates for locked watermarks
- Improves overall application performance
- Prevents accidental position changes

## 🚀 Tips for Best Results

1. **Lock watermarks immediately** after positioning them
2. **Use the grid overlay** for precise positioning before locking
3. **Check the status bar** for helpful guidance
4. **Unlock watermarks** if you need to make final adjustments
5. **Apply watermarks** only after all positions are locked and finalized

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Watermark won't move:**
- Check if it's locked (green border with ✓)
- Click the 🔄 button to unlock it

### **Can't see control buttons:**
- Make sure the watermark is selected (click on it)
- Ensure you're in the visual positioning interface

### **Position keeps changing:**
- Lock the watermark immediately after positioning
- Check that the ✓ button was clicked successfully
- **Watermark moves when scrolling**: This is now fixed - locked watermarks stay in their exact position on the PDF page

**Note:** This feature is designed to provide precise control over watermark positioning while preventing accidental movements that could disrupt your workflow.
